                <p>The president is directly elected for a five-year term, through a version of Instant-runoff voting in which electors rank up to three candidates, and limited to only two rounds in total. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting, second and third preferences from ballots whose first preference candidate has been eliminated are used to determine the winner.[1] However, there has never been an instance where a "run-off" count has been needed since the introduction of directly elected president in the 1980s, as a candidate reached 50% in the first count in all elections.</p>
